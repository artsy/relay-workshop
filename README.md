# relay-workshop

Home for Artsy's [Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/v10.1.3/) peer learning tutorial.

## Why?

Relay is a powerful GraphQL client, but it's complex and difficult to learn. These exercises aim to ease your learning by introducing Relay concepts a little bit at a time. 

## Get Started

1. Clone this repo. 
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`. 

## The Exercises

Each folder under `src/exercises` has a README.md containing instructions. Read and follow them! Any time you see 

Start with [exercise 0 on the Relay compiler](./src/exercises/00-Relay-Compiler/README.md)! 

For support, there is a `completed` folder inside each exercise. If you get stuck, check there to see the code in the completed state. 

## FAQ
### Why is this using an older version of Relay?

These exercises have been built in support of new engineers at Artsy; thus it is based on code that looks like ours. Relay recently released version 11, including hooks, but neither [Artsy's web app](https://github.com/artsy/force) and [mobile app](https://github.com/artsy/eigen) are running it yet.
