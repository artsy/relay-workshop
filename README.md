# Relay Learning Exercises

[Relay](https://relay.dev/docs/v10.1.3/) is a powerful GraphQL client. At Artsy we use it in both our [web app](https://github.com/artsy/force) and [mobile app](https://github.com/artsy/eigen). 

Relay is also complex and difficult to learn. This project contains exercises to help you learn Relay[*](#which-version-of-relay-are-we-learning) by introducing concepts a little bit at a time. 

## Get Started

1. Clone this repo. 
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`. 
3. Confirm that everything installed: if the command `yarn relay` fails, something's not right. Reach out in Artsy's #dev-help Slack channel if you're an Artsy employee, or [create an issue](https://github.com/artsy/relay-workshop/issues/new) if you're not.

## The Exercises

Each folder under `src/exercises` has a README.md containing instructions. Read and follow them!

Any time you see a laptop emoji (ðŸ’»), you're going to edit code or run a command. 

Start with [exercise 0 on the Relay compiler](./src/exercises/00-Relay-Compiler/README.md)! 

For support, there is a `completed` folder inside each exercise. If you get stuck, check there to see the code in the completed state for the exercise.

## FAQ
### Which version of Relay are we learning?

These exercises are for [Relay Modern](https://relay.dev/docs/v10.1.3/new-in-relay-modern/), version 10. 

### Why aren't we learning the most recent version of Relay?

These exercises have been built in support of new engineers at Artsy; thus they are based on code that looks like ours. Relay recently released version 11, including hooks, but neither [Artsy's web app](https://github.com/artsy/force) nor [mobile app](https://github.com/artsy/eigen) are running it yet. 

When our codebase is updated to use a newer version of Relay, we'll update these exercises as well.
