# QueryRenderer

## Introduction - What is a QueryRenderer

- What happens when a query renderer executes
- TODO
  - see relay docs for inspiration
- exercise: create a new page/component
  - note: enough setup should be done that students don't get sidetracked by extracting params from the URL, etc. This should be a focus on creating & connecting the QueryRenderer.
  - create new page/component + UI
  - write graphql query
  - connect component to query with QueryRenderer
- Summarize what the query renderer is doing to connect the component to the graphql API
  - react-relay vs relay
    - relay doesn't include react components; react-relay does
