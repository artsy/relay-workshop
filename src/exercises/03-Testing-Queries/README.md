# Testing Queries

## Introduction â€” What are we testing, and how?

So far we've built an app that queries data. As good dev citizens, we want to write some tests to make sure our app is displaying what we think it's displaying. This will help us prevent future regressions, as well as document our expectations of the system for future developers.

We are going to use Jest, `relay-test-utils`, and React Testing Library to write unit tests for our components that use Relay. There are three main modules that we'll use in our tests (we'll go more into these later):

- `createMockEnvironment`
- `MockPayloadGenerator`
- `QueryRenderer`

## Exercise 3: Testing queries

### Setting up

Start the tests:

ðŸ’» _Run `yarn test:watch` from a console pointed at the root of this project_

This command will run Jest in watch mode, and we'll see our tests re-run as we make changes. If you're unfamiliar with Jest, [here's a nice introduction to its features](https://www.testim.io/blog/jest-testing-a-helpful-introductory-tutorial/).

You should see a message that there are "No tests found related to files changed since last commit.":

```
No tests found related to files changed since last commit.
Press `a` to run all tests, or run Jest with `--watchAll`.

Watch Usage
 â€º Press a to run all tests.
 â€º Press f to run only failed tests.
 â€º Press p to filter by a filename regex pattern.
 â€º Press t to filter by a test name regex pattern.
 â€º Press q to quit watch mode.
 â€º Press Enter to trigger a test run.
```

### Orient yourself

#### Artist3Heading component

We are going to write tests against the Artist3Heading component from the previous exercise, which lives in the Artist3Heading.tsx file. This component renders the artist's name and birth year.

#### Artist3Heading tests

We'll write two tests in this exercise. Both will confirm that the correct information is being rendered by the component, but we'll take two different approaches to the tests: completely isolated from Relay, and integrated with a mocked Relay store.

We've stubbed out a file to hold these tests: Artist3Heading.spec.tsx.

For now, this file contains a single import, and a set of Jest test scenarios stubbed out:

```tsx
import React from "react"

describe("Artist3Heading", () => {
  describe("as an isolated component", () => {
    it("renders the values we give it", () => {})
  })

  describe("as a Relay fragmentContainer", () => {
    it("renders the values from the Relay query", () => {})
  })
})
```

_./Artist3Heading.spec.tsx_

We're going to fill in these test scenarios!

### Test Artist3Heading in isolation

We'll start with a test of our component in isolation from Relay. We don't do this often at Artsy, but it pops up occasionally that we just want to verify some logic in a component, and we don't really care how Relay plays a part.

- guide them to write the silly test (test #1)
- guidance: tell them when to use this kind of test, link them to some force examples, etc

### Test Artist3Heading connected to Relay

- describe relay testing tools
  - createMockEnvironment
    - talk about distinction between this and the default environment
  - resolveMostRecentOperation
- help them build up to the fully mocked test (start close to the first test & add in all the mocking pieces one at a time - basically we don't want to scare them with a big test, we want to slowly guide them to it)
  - createMockEnvironment
  - QueryRenderer (this is the unique part of the test!)
  - resolveMostRecentOperation
- guidance:
  - most of the paperwork/setup/infrastructure is usually abstracted so that the tests can focus on what makes them unique
  -

## Wrapping up

- summarize what we did in this exercise

## Common mistakes

- naming queries
- different components in the tree using different relay environments (some of them the mock, some the default/real one)
  - results in unpredictable/unreliable tests
  - fix can be mocking `defaultEnvironment`

## Resources

- link to relay docs
- link to force & eigen tests/PRs
  - the environment issue that George ran into
- how is relay mocking data? probably some docs in the relay testing tools we can link to.
